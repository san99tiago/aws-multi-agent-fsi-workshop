# AI Agent Theory ü§ñ

## What is an AI Agent?

An AI agent is an autonomous software entity that combines the power of Language Models (LLMs) with programmatic execution capabilities to perform complex tasks.

## Agents in Amazon Bedrock üåü

Amazon Bedrock Agents are software entities that use foundation models (FMs) reasoning to:

- Break down user requests
- Gather relevant information
- Complete tasks efficiently
- Maintain memory between interactions
- Apply built-in security guardrails

### Key Features of Bedrock Agents

1. **Simplified Configuration**

   - Creation in few steps
   - Direct integration with AWS services
   - Customization through natural language instructions

2. **Native Capabilities**
   - Integrated RAG
   - IAM access control
   - CloudWatch monitoring
   - S3 storage

## Fundamental Components üîß

### 1. Cognitive Capabilities

- **LLM Brain**: Natural language processing and understanding through Amazon Nova Pro or Claude
- **Memory**: Conversation context retention through persistent states
- **Reasoning**: Context and knowledge-based decision making
- **Planning**: Creation of orchestrated execution plans

### 2. Tools and Actions

- **Action Groups**: Available tool sets via API Gateway or Lambda
- **APIs**: Integration with external systems and AWS services
- **Functions**: Specific programmatic capabilities via Lambda
- **Knowledge Base**: Accessible knowledge base through RAG (S3 + Vector Store)

## Types of Agents in Bedrock üìã

### 1. Simple Agents

- Execute specific tasks with a base model
- Deterministic workflows
- Example: Bank balance query agent using Lambda

### 2. Advanced Agents

- Handle complex tasks with multiple action groups
- Dynamic decision making with RAG
- Example: Virtual financial advisor with documentation access

### 3. Multi-Agents

- Collaboration between specialized agents through orchestration
- Coordinated task distribution
- Example: troubleshooting supervisor assistant that is able to interact with multiple specialized agents

## Best Practices in Bedrock üìå

1. **Design**

   - Use appropriate base models
   - Implement guardrails from the start
   - Design for high availability

2. **Development**

   - Test in playground
   - Iterate instructions
   - Validate action groups

3. **Production**
   - Monitor usage and costs
   - Keep knowledge updated
   - Scale according to demand
   - Run assessments and QA tests towards the expected I/O
