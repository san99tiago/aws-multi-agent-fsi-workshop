# Understanding Guardrails in AI Applications 🛡️

## What are AI Guardrails?

Guardrails are safety mechanisms implemented in AI systems to ensure responsible, accurate, and secure operation of generative AI applications. Amazon Bedrock Guardrails provides configurable safeguards across all supported foundation models (FMs).
